# Web Components Test

The is an experiment to see how well Web Components work as a common basis for implementing components for React and Angular.

web-component includes an index.html which uses DropDown.js to implement a simple drop-down component.

That DropDown.js is sym-linked into the react-app, which uses it in a React context.
